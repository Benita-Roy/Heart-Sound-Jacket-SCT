## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**Heart Sound Jacket** is designed for medical students, practitioners, and trainers to simulate different cardiac conditions. It uses an Arduino-controlled jacket to mimic the heartsounds corresponding to 5 designated regions in the body for various heart diseases/ conditions. The app allows the user to control which condition is simulated, making learning more immersive and interactive.
